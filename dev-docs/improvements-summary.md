3. **Flawed Drift Implementation**
   - Added numerical integration for simulating drift paths in `integrate_drift_path()`
   - Implemented proper drift detection in `analyze_drift_opportunities()`
   - Used true physical model instead of straight-line approximations

4. **Memory Intensive Graph Building**
   - Replaced full graph building with on-demand node expansion in ST-A*
   - Eliminated the large memory footprint of the full NetworkX graph
   - Avoided the O(N^3) complexity of Floyd-Warshall algorithm

5. **Constraint Handling**
   - Integrated energy capacity constraints directly in the path planning algorithm
   - Added carrying capacity constraint checking for multi-point missions
   - Implemented horizon constraint for limiting time indices

## Performance Improvements

1. **Memory Efficiency**
   - Reduced memory usage by avoiding full graph construction
   - Used on-demand node expansion during search
   - Proper discretization of time values for hashing in closed set

2. **More Accurate Path Planning**
   - Paths account for time-varying conditions properly
   - Energy calculations use physically accurate models
   - Constraint checking prevents infeasible paths

3. **Better Drift Detection**

## Conclusion

The implemented improvements address all the critical issues identified in the critique document. The new spatio-temporal implementation provides a more accurate, efficient, and capable framework for marine navigation planning. The system now correctly handles time-varying currents, implements proper physics for travel costs, detects drift opportunities accurately, and efficiently manages memory while planning paths.

Most importantly, the system now allows for truly time-dependent planning, which is essential for real-world marine navigation where currents and conditions constantly change.

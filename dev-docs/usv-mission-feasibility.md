# USV Mission Feasibility Assessment Framework

## Key Components

1. **Power Modeling & Endurance Calculation**
   - The ElysiumUSV_PowerPlanner.ipynb provides a robust framework for power calculations based on:
     - Solar irradiance data (Darwin has ~5.7 kWh/m²/day annual average)
     - USV speed vs. power consumption curve
     - Battery capacity (4000 Wh) and solar panel characteristics (420W nominal)
     - Payload power requirements and duty cycles
     - Station-keeping vs. transit calculations

2. **Path Planning with Environmental Constraints**
   - The codebase has sophisticated path planning algorithms:
     - Current-aware A* algorithm for optimal routing
     - Energy-optimized pathfinding considering current drift
     - Spatio-temporal path planning for time-varying currents

3. **Geographic Data**
   - Coastal waters data for Australia available in parquet format
   - Copernicus current data in zarr format for the Darwin/Beagle Gulf region

## Mission Requirements Analysis

The mission requires:
- Deploying USV from a specified location
- Visiting 18 survey sites
- Holding station at each site for 72 hours (within 250m radius)
- Returning to Darwin independently

This is a complex operational challenge requiring:
1. **Route optimization** to minimize energy consumption
2. **Power feasibility assessment** to ensure the mission can be completed
3. **Environmental factor analysis** (currents and weather patterns)

+----------------+  +------------------+
```

### 2. Analytical Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Load and process Copernicus current data for the Darwin region
   - Process coastline/obstacles from parquet data
   - Define survey site locations (either preset or interactively specified)

2. **Mission Modeling**
   - Calculate optimal routes between sites with energy-optimal path finding
   - Estimate station-keeping energy requirements at each site
   - Calculate total mission energy requirements
   - Assess mission feasibility based on:
     - Battery capacity
     - Solar generation
     - Current-assisted navigation opportunities
     - Station-keeping requirements (72 hours × 18 sites = 1296 hours)

3. **Visualization & Reporting**
   - Interactive map showing:
     - Survey sites
     - Optimal routes
     - Current patterns
     - Energy consumption estimates
   - Mission timeline with energy profile
   - Recommendations for mission optimization

### 3. Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Data Integration
1. Set up data loading for Copernicus current data
2. Integrate coastline data for obstacle avoidance
3. Create a spatio-temporal environmental model for the region

#### Phase 2: Core Analytics
1. Adapt the power planning calculations for mission-specific analysis
2. Implement route optimization with the energy-optimal path finding
3. Develop station-keeping analysis for each survey site

#### Phase 3: Interactive Tools
1. Create site selection & mission configuration tool
2. Develop mission feasibility analysis dashboard
3. Implement scenario comparison functionality

## Key Considerations

1. **Energy Budget Analysis**
   - The mission has significant station-keeping requirements (72 hours per site)
   - Need to balance:
     - Transit speed (higher speed = higher power consumption)
     - Station-keeping power requirements
     - Available solar energy (daily and seasonal variations)
     - Battery state of charge management

2. **Route Optimization Challenges**
   - Optimal order of site visitation (variant of Traveling Salesman Problem)
   - Favorable current utilization for energy conservation
   - Temporal optimization (scheduling visits based on current and weather patterns)

3. **Operational Constraints**
   - 250m station-keeping radius at each site
   - Multiple mission types with varying site patterns
   - Set-cover problem for optimal site selection if needed

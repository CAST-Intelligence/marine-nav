# Darwin Harbor Marine Navigation - Development Plan

This document outlines the staged development plan for our marine navigation visualization system focused on Darwin Harbor, Australia. The plan is organized into incremental stages, allowing for validation at each step.

## Stage 1: Basic Visualization (Completed)
- ✅ Set up basic deck.gl + MapLibre application structure
- ✅ Implement DataStar for interactive controls
- ✅ Simple vessel position visualization
- ✅ Basic static navigation path
- ✅ Simple vector field implementation (static vectors)

## Stage 2: Enhanced Vector Field Visualization
- Create a more accurate vector field representation using LineLayer
- Implement time-based animation for vector field (simulate changing currents)
- Add color coding based on current velocity/magnitude
- Add interaction to display current information on hover
- Support for switching between different vector field rendering modes:
  - Simple lines (current implementation)
  - Animated lines with variable opacity
  - Directional arrows

## Stage 3: Advanced Particle System
- Implement particle system visualization based on deck.gl wind example
- Create GPU-based particle animation system
- Integrate with real or simulated current data
- Add controls for particle density, speed, and animation parameters
- Implement particle color schemes based on velocity

## Stage 4: Data Integration
- Connect to Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service API
- Implement data fetching for real-time and forecasted ocean currents
- Add support for loading and visualizing different datasets:
  - Ocean currents
  - Wave height and direction
  - Sea surface temperature
- Create data preprocessing pipeline for vector field generation

## Stage 5: Path Planning and Optimization
- Implement A* or other path planning algorithms
- Create cost functions considering:
  - Current strength and direction
  - Vessel characteristics
  - Fuel efficiency
  - Time constraints
- Visualize optimal vs. direct paths
- Allow interactive path updates and re-planning

## Stage 6: Simulation and Analysis
- Implement vessel movement simulation in current field
- Add vessel drift/response to currents
- Create analysis tools for:
  - Estimated time of arrival
  - Fuel consumption projections
  - Deviation from planned path due to currents
- Support for multiple vessel simulations

## Stage 7: UI Enhancements and Production Readiness
- Improve UI controls and organization
- Add comprehensive documentation
- Implement error handling and fallbacks
- Performance optimization for mobile devices
- Support for offline operation
- User preferences and settings persistence

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Vector Field Visualization Evolution
1. **Current Implementation**: Simple LineLayer with start/end points
2. **Enhanced Implementation**: Time-varying LineLayer with animation
3. **Particle System**: Based on deck.gl wind example, using custom shaders:
   - Fragment and vertex shaders for particle rendering
   - Transform feedback for particle animation
   - WebGL2 for advanced features

### Data Handling
1. **Initial Phase**: Use synthetic or pre-processed data
2. **Intermediate Phase**: Fetch from stable APIs, process on client side
3. **Advanced Phase**: Implement server-side preprocessing for heavy datasets

### Performance Considerations
- Use GPU for vector field computations
- Implement level-of-detail control to reduce particles in zoomed-out views
- Reuse textures and buffers when possible
- Use WebWorkers for heavy client-side data processing

### Development Approach
Each stage should be implemented as a standalone example that builds on the previous one, allowing for easy comparison and testing.

## Technical Requirements
- WebGL2 support in browser
- Modern ES6+ JavaScript
- deck.gl 9.1.0 or newer
- Data processing capabilities for vector field data
